# The SKY Programming Language

Rust-like lisp and lisp-like Rust, simple and small.

I want to change/add just just just a few things in Lisp

+ array indexing
+ literal of hashmap and hashset
+ optional ownership from rust
+ a C mode
+ macro from scheme and common-lisp
+ convenient async function
+ match macro
+ limit special form number in 20

for tools, I want

+ better REPL experience, like IPython
+ better and richer library
+ stable language


### 

Sky is a full-lisp.

So, stay on lisp then learn from rust.
